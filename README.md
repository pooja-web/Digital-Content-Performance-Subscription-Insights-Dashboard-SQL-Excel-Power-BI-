# Digital-Content-Performance-Subscription-Insights-Dashboard (SQL-Excel-Power-BI)
# Project Overview
This project analyzes user behavior, content engagement, subscription conversions, and traffic trends for a digital content platform.
Using MySQL for analysis, Excel for ETL & dashboarding, and Power BI for multi-page insights, I built a complete analytics system that tracks:
-Content performance
-Subscription funnel & revenue
-Traffic source insights
-Brand/category-level monetization

This project simulates a real-world Business Analyst role in a digital media company.

# Content Insights

-Identified top-performing articles and high-engagement categories.

-Surface-level engagement metrics (views, avg time spent, shares) helped highlight content ROI.

-Detected underperforming brands with high traffic but low revenue.

# Subscription Funnel Insights

- Mapped the user journey from page visit → subscription, revealing strong and weak landing pages.

- Highlighted high-converting content and customer segments.

- Quantified subscription revenue and its distribution across brands and countries.

# Traffic & Growth Insights

-Analyzed traffic from all channels (Organic, Social, Direct, Referral, Email).

-Provided daily traffic trends, including spikes and dips.

-Enabled automated anomaly detection, helping uncover sudden drops or unusual behavior.

-Linked traffic channels to engagement and subscription performance.

# Business Impact

This dashboard equips business and marketing teams with:

-Clear measurement of what content drives user engagement.

-Data-backed recommendations on how to optimize subscription growth.

-Visibility into traffic patterns and revenue performance by channel and brand.

-A robust foundation for editorial planning, marketing campaigns, and product decisions.
